/*
OBJECTIVE 1: Design and write a Java code that solves a quadratic equation
             ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Please use class and object defintions and do
             not use procedural style.

             Let the roots of ax^2 + bx + c = 0 br p and q. We wish to show the
             following:
                                    p + q = -b / a
             and
                                     pq = c / a

             for non-trivial values a, b, c. Make sure you addres the complex
             numbers as objects.
